Opener with ECU and College Gameday: September 1, 2007

      <td colspan="2">

This game was important because it was our first major school event in the semester after the shootings.  ESPN decided to send the College Gameday crew here (which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Virginia_Tech_College_Gameday_crowd.jpg" target="_blank">kind of a big deal</a>) to cover the relatively minor game as a show of support.  There were lots of tributes, and I didn't get pictures.<br> <br>I did, however, manage to steal a picture of David's awesome sign he made.  Get it?  It's VT Football Coach Frank Beamer.
