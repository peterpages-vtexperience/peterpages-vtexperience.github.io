Apparently at the end of last semester, I was selected as the Campus-Wide Student of the Year.  Yay.  Unfortunately, they spelled my name wrong.  It's OK, though, because it's better than when I was the Campus Wide-Student of the Month in October.

Little did I know that this was going to be the start of a year filled with many somewhat formal events with the CEE department.  This here is some sort of alumni awards ceremony, but the important thing is my tie.  Check it out, it's a gift from Brad when he went through Mongolia on <a href="bradshapiro.blogspot.com" target="_blank">his trip this summer</a>.  He says that it's an old Mongolian language, written in some ornate script.<br> <br>When I asked him what it said, he told me that it's the Mongolian word for "tie."  It figures.

Just a few days later, we found this sketchy looking sight in the TV lounge.  It was gone in the morning, so my theory is that somebody had to take care of some legitimate family business.

And check out this rainbow that we almost missed.<br> <br>The great thing about college is that you can be doing work and then somebody runs up and tells you "there's this great rainbow across the street" and you can easily incite a mob of 20 or 30 people to immediately drop what they're doing and dash outside.
