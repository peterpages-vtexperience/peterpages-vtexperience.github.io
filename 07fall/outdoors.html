And what would a MacAfee's Knob trip be without a stop at The Homeplace?  Not much, I tell you.  In fact, some people even showed up just for dinner.  Their loss... or rather, their weight gain, I suppose.

Anyway, that whole section of the state is characterized by rock layers at odd slanty angles.  At the top of this ridge, some rock is exposed in what looks kind of like teeth, hence the name.

Brad and I surveyed the area and decided not to attempt to rejoin the trail to complete the circuit hike, but rather just head back down to get an early start on dinner.  It would have required some bushwacking through a really steep area that had just been burned in a fire a few years back, so there would have been really loose soil and kind of dangerous.  Anyway, a good decision, methinks.

Later in the week, my dad and I went to walk along the Richmond Floodwall.  It's a big concrete thing that they built to hold back the James during floods.  Fortunately, we haven't had any that large since they built it.  Unfortunately, we've had really heavy rains  over town once or twice, so it actually held the water in and caused some flooding.  Either way, it's appropriately named.<br> <br>Here's the Manchester bridge, showing off some nifty perspective.
