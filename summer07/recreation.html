Miniature Golfing

My dad and I made a couple of trips over to that mini-golf place on Patterson Avenue by West Creek.  Why?  It's really quite cheap, and they have two courses.  Here's a shot of the first one.<br> <br>That scary looking Humpty Dumpty sits over the ramp up to the first hole.  The whole course is poorly maintained, so the fake grass (carpet) is all folded and the ramps and railings are practically falling apart.  It makes the thing more tricky.

Over here is the second course.  We didn't play it on this particular trip, but it is even more gimmicky, as there are a whole bunch of assorted spinning things (like the horse on the left) to mess you up.  Also, the third hole features a sad decapitated clown, for some reason.

I went walking with my mom a couple of times.  One day, I decided that it'd be interesting to try to make a video of the whole thing out of still photos.  It's not as great as I was hoping, but <a href="recreation/rec_006v.wmv">here</a> it is.

On Thursday nights, the local indoor climbing gym has college nights: half price admission and rentals with a valid college ID.  So I met up with one of my friends from high school, and we hung around for a while.

Miniature Golfing Championship of the Whole Known Galaxy

So after several trips to Patterson Avenue to hone our skills, my Dad and I finally faced off at the legendary Bogey's Sports Park course.  Look!  Actual water, and no barriers.  Very risky.

Risky... but enjoyable.<br> <br>It was a very hard fought match.  After 3 holes I was up by 6 strokes.

However, it was inevitable that I would start messing up shortly.  Remember the lack-of-walls thing?  Yeah.

      <td colspan="2">

In the end, things came right down to the line.  We were tied with 6 holes to go, my dad went up by one with 4 to go, and I tied him on the 16th.  It was neck and neck.  Reputations were on the line here, after all.  In the end, a crucial shot on the pentultimate hole put me up by one, and my dad was unable to outputt me on the last hole.  So I won, and get to hold on to the title... for now, at least.
