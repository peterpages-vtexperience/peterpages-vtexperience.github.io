I was fortunate enough to be able to work again for the same company that I worked for last summer.  They've got a really good, casual work atmosphere, and I got to do some really cool stuff, like drafting site plans and making intelligent spreadsheets.  See for yourself.

This one day, I got the chance to go on an Intern Hard Hat tour.  Essentially, it's just a job site tour.  This particular event was put on by the local AIA chapter, so I got to hang out with a bunch of architects all afternoon.  <a href="http://www.aiaric.org/news/intern-hard-hat-tour-vcu-adcenter">Here</a>'s some more information.

The place was still quite under construction.  As far as I'm concerned, that just made it all the more interesting.  The architects weren't as impressed as I was, though.

Look at this stuff here.  It's so snazzy, what with the whole integrating the Jefferson Hotel's old stable into the building.  They had to add structural stiffening cantilevered over from the new section (see the top of the above picture) just to bring it up to code.

State Capitol Tour

The last week I was in town the company arranged this tour for all of the interns in the company.  Even the Blacksburg people drove up to Richmond for the day.  We got to take a tour of the Virginia State Capitol, a project our company did a lot of work on a few years back.<br> <br>This here's a picture from the local paper of the project under construction.

And here's the finished thing.  They tore up the whole front lawn of the place and put in a new visitor's center, gigantic meeting rooms, a cafe, and a few offices.  They also totally renovated the main building.  The senators and delegates met in the an adjacent building while these repairs were going on, and only just moved back in earlier this year.  You know, we've got to look our best when the Queen's in town.

But this was the real reason why we went: the new section of the building.  The sloped roof here is actually the underside of the capitol steps, leading from the old building down a fairly steep slope to the new wing.

See?  Just grass.  We designed a hole, and somebody else put a building inside it and then a third person came along and made the top look nice.  But I can assure you that that site drains REALLY well.<br> <br>Interesting side note: the building at the bottom of the hill is one of the Virginia circuit court buildings, and the row of TV vans is for Michael Vick's arraignment.
