It was at about this time that a few of my other cousins snuck out to "decorate" the groom's vehicle.  Who was it?  I'm not telling, and neither will these pictures, because you definitely can't just go back to the other pictures and figure out from their clothing who everybody is, no sir.

Interesting story: the cheap little bell you can see hanging from the rear view mirror in this picture took the mirror with it when they tried to remove it after driving off.  I think they are looking for some good adhesives to put it back on at the moment.
