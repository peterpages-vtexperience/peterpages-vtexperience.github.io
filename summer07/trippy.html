One of the many reasons that I kept extremely busy and didn't have time to clean up my room was the large number of great trips I got to take.  Some were to other states, others were simply to the store or to downtown.  In any case, they are a big part of what made this summer so great.

Anyway, I was meeting up with the people for Dinner (a SURPRISE dinner, no less) around 7 or 8pm, but I got there a few hours early.  So I went and played disc golf at the local course (a very nice course, by the way).  However, I still had an hour or two to waste, so I decided to go on a tour of <i>The Bridges of Montgomery County</i>.<br> <br>This here is a bridge on the 460 bypass near the Main Street interchange.  It is surprisingly tall.

Click <a href="../april06/roadtonowhere.html">here</a> to see a previous trip to the illustrious road.<br> <br>Anyway, after seeing this bridge, it became my goal to find the other, larger one on the same road.  Armed with my trusty Virginia Atlas and Gazetteer, I set off to find [dun dun DUUUNNNN] the tallest bridge in the state.

And why not?  We eventually had the Richmond Concert Band come on and play patriotic Sousa-esque pieces before the culmination of the evening: the 1812 Overture.  They claimed that we were the only people in the country to play it as originally arranged, with an orchestra, fireworks, a carillon, and cannon (pictured.)

The Baltimore Trip that Sort of Wasn't

So... I drove to meet up with some more college persons in Maryland.  We were going to go to a Baltimore Orioles game on one of their Friday college-students-get-really-cheap-admission nights.  However, getting there was problematic.  First, it took me a full hour to traverse the 7 miles between 95 and the Wilson bridge on the beltway around DC.  Then, we got this flat tire in the rain on the way from Elaine's house in Bowie to Baltimore.

But with a little help from a gas station attendant outside of the NSA headquarters, we were off again.  Unfortunately, upon our arrival, we found out that they were out of tickets.  Darn Yankees.  Darn Alex Rodriguez having your birthday.  Darn Alex Rodriguez being on the verge of his 500th home run.  Darn you teams and your having to finish a game that got rained out last month.  There were quite a few factors that led to this impasse.  Anyway, we hung around Baltimore for a while before going back to Jeremy's hometown on Annapolis to waste the night away... playing card games at a local coffee shop.
