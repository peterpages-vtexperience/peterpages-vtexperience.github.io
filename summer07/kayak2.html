My venture crew always goes on some sort of extended trip over the summer.  This year we decided to check out the well-reviewed Pamlico Sea Base, specifically their sea kayaking program.  I thought it was a fairly good time, but you can decide for yourself.<br> <br>Oh, and I'd like to thank all of our adult advisors for giving me copies of their pictures to pick through.  Three viewpoints make for a better overall story, in my opinion.

Even that always wasn't enough.  Even out in the middle of the sound you could still scrape bottom.  It never gets more than 5 or 10 feet deep, averaging between 6 inches and a foot deep in many places.  Again, the maps will give you approximate depths, if you care.  The white stuff is over 5 feet, the blue stuff is less, the green stuff can be shoals in low water, and the stuff inside the black lines is always land.

Hey, it's a group photo at the pre-lunch snack stop.  We're essentially parked on a gigantic sand bar made from dredged materials, and you can't see land behind us.  On the map, this is part of the spoil area near the inlet at the upper right corner of the southwest section, meaning we've made about 12 miles in the 3 hours since our departure.  Not great, but with the sandbars we'll take it.

So we kept on going, following this line of duck blinds north towards a destination over the horizon.  It's a really weird but neat feeling, just paddling towards something that should be there but that you won't be able to see for another hour, and even then that you will still be 90 minutes away from.

Surprisingly, the bugs weren't that bad this morning.  However, by the time we set off the sun was already giving indications that it was going to be another scorcher.  I had on long sleeves to cover my arms, a hat and bandanna for my face, ears, and neck, and a spray skirt to guard my legs.  That left my hands unprotected.  Even after applying my SPF 60 sunblock a good 8 or 10 times over the course of the day, at every break in paddling, they still got terribly sunburned.  It was hott, with two Ts.

However, due to a 5 degree error early on and some nasty crosswinds, we wound op on Wainwright island.  Do you see it on the map, it's really small, just left of center near a channel marker between Hog island and the core banks?  Trust me, it's there.

It just happens to be only a big mound of sand from dredging, like our snack stop of the previous day.  The only difference is that instead of trees and shrubs, this island had tremendous winds, lots of blustery sand, and roughly six bazillion (I'm an engineering student, you can trust my numerical estimation) birds of various types.<br> <br>The wind was big factor.  Here, some of the ladies struggle to move their tents after we discovered that the loose sand of our initial campsite was causing drifts of several inches of sand to build up against and inside the tents.3:44 AM 9/19/2007  Oh boy!

Check out just how desolate this place is.  Here Scott pulls a Tatooine-esque manuver, standing at the crest of the hill... er, mound of sand as the sun sets.  We just need another sun, and we've got George Lucas all set for another movie trilogy.  He's probably just going to the bathroom, but that's not important.  Oh, that reminds me: we had a good system for keeping the gendered bathroom options separate, with the ladies off by the steep sided dunes (good for hiding behind) and the gentlemen over by the dead pellican.

Thursday: Heading for Home

    </tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">
<h3>Long Story Short:</h3>We were going to paddle north across the inlet to Ocracroke today, however when Reggie got up (at 1:30am) and checked his weather radio, he found out that the wind was even worse than when we went to bed and that there were going to be waves of 3-5 feet (that's bad) in the middle of the sound, where we were going to be.  So when I got up at 3:30 in preparation for the general wake up at 4, he told me to go back to bed.  Eventually, we rounded everybody up around 5:30 and decided not to make the big jump across the dangerously turbulent sound.  Rather, we were going to paddle through the shallows (bad) into the wind (worse) to reach the ferry terminal on Cedar Island that we were going to be going to after visiting Ocracroke anyway rather than waiting out the wind.  The reports said that the wind was going to stay strong and just change direction, so there really wasn't another option.</td></tr>

      <td colspan="2">

So after day broke and things started to become visible, we started the long paddle into the wind to reach our final destination.  The treks are designed to move from Cape Lookout to Ocracroke so that you have the wind at your back.  By essentially pulling a 180, we were heading straight into the wind coming out of the Southwest.  Not necessarily fun.  We paused at Harbor Island for a break, then took a long pull up the side of a few marshes to reach the calm behind Hog Island point, at which point we took a well deserved snack break.

But eventually it became time to set off again behind the wind shadow of the island, before turning left and heading around the north end of the Cedar Island Bay before turning north again to skirt an actual landmass until reaching the Cedar Island ferry terminal.  Horray.
  Unfortunately, we weren't counting on reaching more shallow secions and wound up having to drag all of our boats across a sand bar to reach the deeper channel near the shore.  Weird.
