My venture crew always goes on some sort of extended trip over the summer.  This year we decided to check out the well-reviewed Pamlico Sea Base, specifically their sea kayaking program.  I thought it was a fairly good time, but you can decide for yourself.<br> <br>Oh, and I'd like to thank all of our adult advisors for giving me copies of their pictures to pick through.  Three viewpoints make for a better overall story, in my opinion.

We all met up on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon for the 4+ hour trip to eastern North Carolina.  Here, the lot of us (in our snazzy, official tie-dyed shirts) gather in the parking lot of the local YMCA.  Why the unusual hand motion on my part?  Frisbee, of course.

Hey, it's the Pamlico Sea Base.  More specifically, it's the spiffy logo of the place.  Anyway, the Sea Base is located at the local council's Boy Scout reservation, which had closed for the season the week before.  There wasn't anybody else signed up for trips in our week, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.

After dropping off our stuff, we headed down to the Pamlico River to do the sea kayaking expedition version of swim checks: kayaking instruction and wet exits.  But first, we had to get our assigned spray skirts.

And now, in a sign of things to come, we had a time getting somebody's paddle unstuck.  You see, sand grit gets caught up in between the two sections of paddle, and if you can't get it apart the sand will harden and they'll never come apart.  So at the end of the day, washing out your paddle is important, and sometimes it takes a couple of people to get the job done.

Take a gander at that lovely lighthouse.  Very few people make the journey down this far to see the 5th major lighthouse of the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
