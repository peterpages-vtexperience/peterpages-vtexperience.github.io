<p>When I can, I try to remain active with my Boy Scout troop back in Richmond.  When I heard that we were heading back to Gettysburg just a few weeks after I was to get back from college, I jumped at the opportunity to come along with them, this time as an Assistant Scoutmaster.</p>
<p>For those of you who are new to this site, the pictures are broken into sections, as designated below.  Each picture has a bit of narration next to it, since you probably don't have someone there with you to explain each one personally.  If you want to see a larger version of a given picture, simply click the thumbnail image and a larger version will load on your screen.  Use your browser's back button to return to this page.  After you finish a section, you can return to the top to find links to other portions of the pictures.</p>

After a fairly uneventful ride, the troop arrived in Gettysburg, PA.  After setting up camp and grabbing a quick lunch, our first stop was the National Park Service visitor center.  Here, the troop gathers outside after having a half hour to explore the place.

As we were working diligently towards the historic trails award as a troop and wanted to get all five sections covered, we quickly moved on to the next part of our walking tour of the battlefield: the cemetery.  Fortunately for us, it was located right across the street.  Amazingly, the guys were moderately compliant with this sign.

In addition to being a large and stately place, the cemetery also served as a great shortcut to our first major hike of the weekend, the Johnny Reb trail.  For this hike (and most of the weekend), Scott served as our fearless leader/navigator.  Here, he points us in the right direction in a manner reminiscent of General Winfield Scott Hancock, above him.

If they love anything more than cannon at Gettysburg, it would have to be monuments.  According to Wikipedia, there are some 1400 monuments and markers scattered across the battlefield.  That is in comparison to the 400 cannon.<br> <br>3 of 3 former SPLs agree: monuments make great chairs.
