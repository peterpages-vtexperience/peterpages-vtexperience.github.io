In no time at all, we had reached the top of Little Round Top.  From the steep slopes down towards the fields leading to the confederate positions on Seminary Ridge, you can see why it was such a crucial position for the Union to hold.  Given the exertion required, our guys could hardly imagine how they expected to run up the mountain wearing long sleeved wool clothing, caring all their gear, in July of all months and still have enough energy to overcome the entrenched union forces.
