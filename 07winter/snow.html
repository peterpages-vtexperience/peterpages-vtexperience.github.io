Finally, we get a good snow here in Blacksburg.  In fact, with a scientifically measured (ruler on the roof of a car) 5.5 inches, it's the most we've gotten in my 2.5 years here.

The weather forecast had been predicting some terrible weather for a few days, but frankly nobody paid it any attention.  Several times the previous semester they'd made similar promises of 1-3 inches and things of this nature, only for us to get flurries at best.  So when we awoke to significant white stuff on the ground and in fact still coming down, we were all quite excited.

Check out how stately and wintery the building is right now.  They didn't even get around to plowing all of the sidewalks until at least 3pm.  I guess they wanted it to finish snowing and sleeting before they took care of business.  Let's not worry about the whole safety thing.

And here we have the Drillfield.  It is very white today.<br> <br>Yeah, a few people were quite sure that they'd cancel morning classes.  That didn't happen.  Fortunately, the snow just kept coming and never really changed over until we had 5.5 inches of snow and snow alone.  It was very powdery, check out <a href="snow/snow_003v.avi">this video</a>.

So after my first class I had a break and walked around campus taking pictures that hopefully turned out to be fairly scenic.  What follows is a montage of pictuers from my peripatetic wanderings.<br> <br>Here's Burruss (again), this time from the War Memorial Chapel by the <a href="/web/20081120065518/http://www.vtmagazine.vt.edu/memorial07/images/prevail.2.jpg" target="_blank">cenotaph</a>.  It was a good place to just sit back and watch stuff happen... like <a href="snow/snow_006v.avi">this football game</a>.

Hey, it's the good ol' HC again, shown here from the Chem/Phys parking lot.  We always lose our protective curtain in the winter... it's like we're all exposed, somehow.

Here's the big Prices Fork commuter lot.  It was fairly empty, and most of the cars that were there looked like they hadn't been moved all morning.  That's probably the safe plan anyway, and it would also help to explain the unusually crowded bus stops.

But after some more classes, meetings, and dinner, it was time to enjoy the white stuff while it lasted.  Here, a group assembles for sledding.  Would you have guessed that Hillcrest is on the crest of a hill?  It makes for some of the best sledding on campus.

Unfortunately my batteries died before I could capture the mayhem that ensued, but I got some new ones to document the finished project of this year's Snow Jack.  Check out all of his upright majesty.  The proportions aren't that great, but at least he's standing once again.  Plus, the mortarboard just seals the deal.
