In this exciting episode, our hero learns an important lesson about the importance of teamwork when he and his estranged colleagues have to come together to defeat an old arch-nemesis.  No, wait, that was this week's episode of <u>Popular Sci-Fi Television Show</u>.  This month... lots of stuff happens.  As usual.  And it makes the month go quickly, and it also makes us want to write about it - which explains the unusual punctuality of this update.

Section 3:<br>Mid-NerdFest Dance

</h3><p>

First, NerdFest = Awesome.  It's this competition between Hillcrest (my building) and Main Campbell Hall (the other honors community) to see who is "better" as determined by a predetermined slate of 9 events.  However, it had been decided that after about half of the events that we would have some kind of social event.  This is what the powers that be decided to do: a dance in the style of a High School mixer.  It had a really good turnout, with around 2/3 of the residents of both buildings at least making an appearance.  Here's how it went.
