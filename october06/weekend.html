In this exciting episode, our hero learns an important lesson about the importance of teamwork when he and his estranged colleagues have to come together to defeat an old arch-nemesis.  No, wait, that was this week's episode of <u>Popular Sci-Fi Television Show</u>.  This month... lots of stuff happens.  As usual.  And it makes the month go quickly, and it also makes us want to write about it - which explains the unusual punctuality of this update.

Although this was a Monday and technically not a weekend, there was still nobody here.  Jeremy had just gone shopping at Wal-Mart and came back with a tent.  Naturally, we had to set it up to take a good look at it.

Virginia Tech buys a whole bunch of junk, and replaces it in a relatively timely fashion.  In order to get rid of all of their old junk without having to worry about hazardous material regulations (and to make a few quick bucks, too), they run the nonannual (9 times per year) VT surplus auction.

The great thing about the surplus auctions are the random items they sell.  Last semester it was the dump truck, last month it was the 200 coffee cups for $5 and the forklift, and this time it was the "Phone Booth (Old)."  Here's what it looked like.  It actually had a pay phone inside but was in pretty rough shape.  As you can see here, it was missing a pane of glass.  We didn't think it was worth buying, but obviously somebody did since it wound up going for $500.

I showed up because I had a hankerin' for some projectors.  Unfortunately, they all went for over $150, more than I'm willing to pay for a projector of questionable operability.

Look at those auctioneers go!  They were on a big cart with battery powered speakers and just rolled down the length of the building as the 700-some item auction progressed.  You can also see the guy with the little cart complete with battery powered computer and wireless router to transmit the results back to the front desk/cashier.<br> <br>Anyways, <a href="weekend_011s.wav">here's what the auction sounded like</a> presented as a hube (14MB) WAV sound file.

Now Jeremy has 3 screens in his room.  The default orientation is laptop on one screen and the TV and monitor on extended desktop, showing the TV tuner.  This way, the big TV faces the futon and the monitor faces the backup (or gentile) couch.

For some reason, a few freshmen are not at all punctual with removing their laundry from the laundry room in the basement of the building.  So a few of us decided to go downstairs and take some pictures for the purpose of ridiculing them on the email listserv.  We got lazy and never sent the email, but the pictures remain.<br> <br>Here, I do my best Vanna White to show off the fabulous laundry!
