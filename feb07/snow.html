There are no where near as many pictures as last year in this month's issue.  But hey, who's counting.  Hopefully as the function of our camera improves, the number of pictures taken will increase.  However, in the meantime you can expect more pictures from "guest photographers."

Section 2:<br>Snow Daze 2007

</h3><p>

Blacksburg is well known for its variable weather, but one thing has always been constant: brutal and snowy winters.  Recently, however, things have been starting to change.  It could be global warming, it could just be unfavorable weather conditions.  In any case, this was our one significant snow for the year, so we knew we had to make the most of it.<br> <br>Oh, and thanks, Elaine, for most of these pictures.

It started snowing around mid-afternoon.  By 5pm, it had started sticking.  Finally, around 8:00, the snow had finally accumulated to a usable depth.  As if by hidden signal, people started spilling from the building.

One of the dangerous parts about this particular sledding venue is the grove of trees that you run into towards the bottom of the hill.  When coupled with the difficulty in steering my particular sled, it was inevitable that somebody would eventually hit a tree.  It was me, but it was more of a one-armed hug than a collision.<br> <br>Oh, and if you look carefully, you can see Julia deftly avoiding both me and the tree, zipping around to her left in this timed exposure shot.

Because of these immense dangers (and the fact that it was cold out there), we made a break for the building.  It was every man (person) for himself (theirself), but despite the reckless nature of the dash, everyone made it back to the safe and well defended confines of Hillcrest, awaiting the next snow and the Virginia Tech Police Department's newly implemented Marauding Bandit Eradication Program.
