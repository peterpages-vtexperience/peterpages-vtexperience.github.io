There's not much time for zany antics with exams looming on the horizon.  There's even less when work begins.  But even if only for a few moments here and there, some photogenic events managed to sneak their way onto the website over the summer.  Check back for the next X days (where X = whatever the <a href="http://www.peterpages.net/countdown.html">Back 2 Skewl Countdown Timer</a> says) for occasional updates when something photogenic occurs.

That's not to be confused with his short bike, his off-road bike, or his "that one with the trailer" bike.  He fabricated them himself out of older, less eccentric bicycles.

You may have heard references made to D2sday on this website.  Well, this is possibly the only picture in existence of the largest D2sday event... 22 Hillcrustaceans strong.  It all started when the ECE/CS crowd and the everybody else crowd happened to be leaving for D2 (on Tuesday) at the same time.  So we all decided to sit together.  And this was the result: 6 straight tables of nonstop excitement... Honors Community-style.

I decided to take advantage of my week and a half long break before I had to start work again to visit a few cool spots around Richmond.  Here, I'm in the heart of downtown, on the southern side of Belle Island.  Up until the 60s, there was a <a href="http://www.vtunderground.com/other/belleisle.htm" target="_blank">hydroelectric power plant</a> complete with some short dams to power streetcars in Southside.  On this side of the island, the dams are still holding and allow all of these giant rocks to be exposed, allowing you to "rock hop" all of the way across to the island.  See a picture <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=q7mzf48jbvt2&style=o&lvl=1&scene=3395440" target="_blank">here</a>.  Sure, it looks kind of dull, but it's actually a fairly cool place, especially when some VCU students are playing some groovy bongo drum music up the river someplace and it's echoing all around and the sun is shining, and there's a slight breeze, and the sewage treatment plant downstream is turned off.

We're getting fiber optic cables installed in our neighborhood.  I don't know why, nobody has that good of a connection, but anyways, during the digging a contractor cut off our cable (TV, etc.).  So while all of the involved parties bickered about who would need to do the permanent repairs, Comcast (I think) was nice enough to run this jury-rigged cable down our driveway and into a slightly underground plug that I'd never seen before.  Problem solved.<br> <br>Well, I though it was funny.  At least at the time.

But then one day, as I was coming back from lunch, one of the IT guys mentionned casually to me, "So I hear that they're kicking you out."  "WHA...?" I replied.<br> <br>Long story short, a new full time person was moving into the department, and as I would only be there for another month or so, they decided to make me a "drifter."  Fortunately for me, this was also the same day that our department head was moving to Florida, so my temporary location is... the Site Planning and Engineering team leader's office.  That is, until they hire somebody new.  Which won't be any time soon.

And at the end of the summer, my work decided to hold some sort of office party.  They also had a contest using the same kits as the raingutter regatta event from my Cub Scouting days.  One of my coworkers put the thing together with some spiffy outriggers and painted it Primer White.  It wasn't anywhere near as outlandishly decorated as the other boats, however, it was very streamlined and Americas Cup-esque.  So I managed to win the event.  Yay.  Actually, I was second, but the guy who beat me is the guy on the left of this picture, and as you can see if you look closely, he is carrying his boat in this shot. So boo yeah.
