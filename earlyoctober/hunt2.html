<table width="90%" class="intro"><tr><td><br>So... um... yeah.  I haven't done one of these in a while.  And I figured, as long as I have all of this space, why not go all out and do some crazy stuff.  But it's too bad I'd already taken all of these pictures and advertised a new page.  So here's a sampling of the random peripatetic-type stuff that I did during the month of October.</td></tr>

    <h3>Section 2:<br>Hall Events</h3>
    <p>The students living in Hillcrest know how to work hard.  However, they also know how to relax.  Below are a sampling of some of a few activities that have been going on around the hall.  Also see some of the Halloween pictures (in the next section) for some more examples of this.</p>
