<p><b><i>So... um... yeah.  I haven't done one of these in a while.  And I figured, as long as I have all of this space, why not go all out and do some crazy stuff.  But it's too bad I'd already taken all of these pictures and advertised a new page.  So here's a sampling of the random peripatetic-type stuff that I did during the month of October.</b></i></font></p></td></tr>

    <p class="maroonbginline">Slusher Tower has long been considered... umm... aesthetically unappealing when compared to other Virginia Tech buildings.  However, the trait that makes it so obtrusive (<a href="http://www.studentprograms.vt.edu/vtour/slushertower.php">click here</a>)- its height- is also what makes it relatively good for picture taking.  As always, click on a picture to enlarge.</font></p>

    <p>So, here we are, looking east along the Drillfield towards Alumni Mall.  The curved building on the right is the library, the squat building on the left is Patton Hall (read more for further details), and one can just make out War Memorial Chapel with the Pylons near the center with Torgersen Bridge (home to a really nice study area) just peeking out above it.</font></p>

    <td colspan="2"><center><font COLOR="Maroon" FACE="Arial, sans-serif"> Here, we have Patton Hall (foreground) and McBryde (background).  I'll be spending a lot of time in the Drillfield-front real estate of Patton, as it is home to VT's department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.  I currently have classes in McBryde, home to the Math Department (plus Computer Science and Sociology, but... umm... I don't have classes for those in that building.  You can also make out the smokestack for the Virginia Tech power plant... a major energy supplier for the region.</font></center>
