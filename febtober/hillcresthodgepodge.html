He pledged $10,000 of university money towards any project we chose that would give back to the students and faculty of Virginia Tech.  Thus, the Charles Steger $10K Challenge got under way.

    <td colspan="2">The first real event put on by the $10K Challenge committee was a Lunch/presentation designed to show off the ideas put forward by various Honors community members.  We heard about reducing light pollution, putting art on campus, and creating a foreign language online tutoring lab, among other ideas.</td>

Fortunately, one good thing did come out of it... the painters left an attic door unlocked one night, leaving us enough time to explore and find (amongst the old toilets and tubs of carpet glue) a classic 1970 Wurlitzer Statesman jukebox!</td>
