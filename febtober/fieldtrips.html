The ever unpredictable Blacksburg weather (and its equally unpredictable Hillcrest Residents) will be sure to astound (or appall) you this month.</td></tr>

    <p>Hillcrustaceans are naturally social.  Therefore, it makes sense that they travel places in groups.  Here are just a few escapades of the building's residents.</p>

    <td colspan="2">Yeah, so I stood around for about 2 hours, we lost, oh well.  Basketball at Tech obviously doesn't have quite the established traditions of football.  But we're getting better, and they're working on it.  Just check out the orange-ness of the student section (the left side).

Well, 15 minutes away in Christiansburg, there exists such a place.  A group of Hillcrustaceans made a reservation, had an additional space left at their table, and decided to invite me to come along.  Here's the crowd, preparing for departure.  Check out Jeremy's dance-type routine.</td>

    <td colspan="2">And now, useless background information.  Hillcrest residents can get commuter parking passes.  I don't know why, since we're the closest to the residential lots of all the residential buildings, but oh well.  So this is how far away parking is from the building.  Check out stately old Hillcrest in the background, as Erin and Jeremy walk to Chris' car.</td>
