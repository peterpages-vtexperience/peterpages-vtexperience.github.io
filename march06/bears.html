Bears</h3>

      <p>The Hillcrest Bear: we've talked about him on a few
other occasions. You've seen him playing DDR and assaulting softball
players. However, he does have a more mundane side. We join him on a
trip to dinner at D2 and a trip the Math Emporium with his entourage to
take a test for one of his classes... or something.</p>
