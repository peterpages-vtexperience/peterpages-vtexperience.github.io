      <h3>Section 1:<br>
Cows</h3>

    
      <p>To stay in the Hillcrest Honors Community, students are
required to take a discussion-group class each semester. This year,
somebody in my session decided to try to arrange the group's
activities, guest speakers, and topics to be as interesting as
possible. So this month, one of our trips was to Virginia Tech's dairy
science complex to see... the Fistulated Cows! Holy Cow, Batman. Stay
tuned next month for the trip to the Virginia Tech Transportation
Institute and the Smart Road.</p>
      <p>Also, thanks to Jeremy, special guest contributor of about 1/2 of this trip's pictures.</p>

work towards their favor.</td>

touching the boat.</td>
