    to join their mailing list in just enough time to recieve an email saying that 
    the very next day was the last day to sign up for this amazing trip! It was 
    really really really cool because... well, I&#39;ll just let you find out as the 
    trip progressed. Suffice to say, there was no way I was going to miss this trip 
    if I had anything to say about it.</b></i></font></p>

We're still well outside of the part of the bridge actually supported by the arch.

I'd like to take this moment to point out what we were walking on: an 18 inch wide steel plate with two handrails and a shin rail.  You know, a shin rail.  To keep you from slipping out under the handrail.  Which would have been really bad.</font></center>

    <td colspan="2"><center><font COLOR="Maroon" FACE="Arial, sans-serif">And here's another example of the interesting shots one can find by forgoing a fear of heights and looking over the side.  This is a shot of the actual arch part of the bridge seemingly melding into the ground.  In actuality, it rests on some house-sized (and that's just above the ground) concrete abutments, which you can't see in this view.</font></center>

    <td colspan="2"><center><font COLOR="Maroon" FACE="Arial, sans-serif">So after a while we had to turn around and start heading back towards the north end (where the cars were parked), and by holding the camera up, I got this view of the group stretched out along the catwalk with the rising arch behind.</font></center></td>

It was neat to see scenic vistas like this through the wide open spaces in the bridge.  These big gaps let the wind flow freely through the bridge, and also give you the chance to realize just how high up you are...</font></center>

I think I can sum it up by saying that you don't have to be crazy to work for the West Virginia highway department, but it helps.

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><center><font COLOR="Maroon" FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Look at all of these bolts!  The largest joints on the bridge have over 2,700 of them.  By virtue of the shear number of bolts, the overall stiffness of the bridge is increased.  Because the individual bolt holes have relatively large tolerances, the huge number of bolts reduces the wiggle in the joints.  In fact, at the center of the 3,000 foot span, the bridge only shakes about 3 inches when a large truck goes over.  Which was disconcerting enough, if you ask me.  By the way, this is the center of the bridge (yet again).</font></center></td>
