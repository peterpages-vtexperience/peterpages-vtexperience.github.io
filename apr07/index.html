First, we plotted the points on a 2x3 foot piece of grid paper.  Then we connected the dots and figured out where along those lines the two foot contour lines went, based on some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation" target="_blank">linear interpolation</a>.  It was really nifty to see how it worked out.

Another thing that I worked on this month is the website for Chi Epsilon, the National Civil Engineering Honor Society.  They used to have a website, but it was still on the ce.vt.edu server, meaning they hadn't updated it since the department expanded their name to "Civil AND ENVIRONMENTAL Engineering."  So we had to start from scratch.  It still needs some filling in, but if you want to check it out it is at:<br><a href="http://chiep.cee.vt.edu" target="_blank">chiep.cee.vt.edu</a>

Mitch and Susan have been having a prank war with Jeremy. First they filled up his shower with newspapers. Then, he did something to them that they haven't yet found, but I'm quite sure that they're not going to be happy when they find out what it is.  So anyway, to start off round two they went out to Wal-Mart and bought a bunch of Easter grass on sale.  Over 100 packages, in fact.

For the longest time I've been looking to get a second screen for my computer.  I could only fit a flat panel there, so I've been looking for a flat panel.  I said that the first time I could find one for uner $75 I'd take it.  So at the April surplus auction, I finally found one.  It is really great, and has made the coding for this site much easier.
