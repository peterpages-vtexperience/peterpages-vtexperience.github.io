Colloquium Trip: Virginia Tech Transportation Institute/Smart Road<br>


Some Random Other Stuff! </h3>


      
      <p>To stay in the Hillcrest Honors Community, students are
required to take a discussion-group class each semester. This year,
somebody in my session decided to try to arrange the group's
activities, guest speakers, and topics to be as interesting as
possible. So this month, one of our trips was to&nbsp; the Virginia
Tech Transportation
Institute to take a tour of the Smart Road.</p>


      
      <p>And then stay tuned for some other stuff from the
month... complete with the bear.</p>

represent an interstate highway (hint: it's the pavement). &nbsp;They
can test different signage techniques, especially with regards to
visibility, using the overhead sign bridge ahead. &nbsp;Also, notice
the ridiculously frequent lightposts. &nbsp;This is so they can
duplicate all major spacings seen on different highways by lighting
them in different pattersn. &nbsp;They can also move the lights up and
down, plus, each post is equipped with three different types of lights.
&nbsp;Those other cantilevered stalks are commercial snowmakers from a
bankrupt ski-resort. &nbsp;They can be used to create fog, rain, or
snow (temperature permitting). &nbsp;Cool, huh?</td>

      <td colspan="2">But quite possibly the coolest part of the entire
road was the bridge. &nbsp;It's the tallest bridge in the entire state,
interestingly enough. &nbsp;However, it doesn't hold a candle to the <a href="../ASCE/NRGB/newrivergorgebridge1.html">New River Gorge Bridge</a>
over in West Virginia. &nbsp;The road actually ends just over the
bridge at a nice turn around loop. &nbsp;Their original plan was to
punh the roadd through to 81 just south of Salem, but then they opened
up the new 460 section, taking pressure off of the road for a while.
&nbsp;When/if they do get around to doing it, they will put in another
two lanes and a parallel span (starting right about where I'm standing)
to bring it up to spec.</td>

One day, while reading the Collegiate Times (our school newspaper -
yes, I was fairly bored), I noticed a couple of very extremist articles
on the editorial page (such as one stating that more lenient issuing of
concealed weapon permits are what we need to combat sexual assaults).
&nbsp;I traced back these to the letters to which they were responding,
and posted all of the applicable editorial pages on the wall outside my
room. &nbsp;The next day, I found a crowd of people sitting in the hall
discussing the issues brought up in the articles.</td>

(that's him in the background), so he asked me to stick him someplace
