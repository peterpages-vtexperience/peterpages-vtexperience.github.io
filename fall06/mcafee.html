Section 3:<br>McAfee's Knob Hike

</h3><p>

One weekend, Brad had the great idea to go hiking at McAfee's Knob, an impressive outcropping of rock on a ridge outside of Roanoke.  It's about 45 minutes away, but the ride is down a winding road and is entertaining enough to make the trip almost as great as the hike itself.  Plus, once you're at McAfee's Knob, you're only about 5 minutes away from The Homeplace, so how can you go wrong?

That would be minutes of resting to prevent lactic acid buildup in your legs.  Here Brad, our fearless leader/Undergraduate Hall Director, makes sure we aren't ambushed by pirate-ninjas while resting.

But we eventually got to the rocky outcropping that is the Knob itself.  There's a fairly nice view from the top.

OHNOWATCHOUT!  No, seriously, there's a foot-wide ledge about 3 feet below the brink here, so I'm only in mild danger.  Plus, if I fell its only about a 30 foot drop down into some prickly looking bushes.

Yep, 3.5 miles down a relatively steep hill back to Route 311.  Unfortunately, it was a rather hot day so I only had about a cup of water for that whole trip.

And since we were already in Catawba, we figured we might as well meet up with some non-hiking types at a designated time for a good, hearty meal at The Homeplace.

The Homeplace is such a popular restaurant that there's almost always a substantial line to get a table, so we reluctantly played duck duck goose while waiting.  What a bummer.

But here's the majority of the crowd looking fully stuffed.  $13 for more than enough delicous food and some ridiculously tasty lemonade.

While we were there, for some reason Brad's car decided that it wanted to keep its brake lights on at all times.  Naturally, his battery died during the 3 hour period where we were at the Homeplace.  My theory is that it was mad that we didn't bring it any of the fried chicken or apple butter from inside.
