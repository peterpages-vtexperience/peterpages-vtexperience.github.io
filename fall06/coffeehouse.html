Section 5:<br>September 2006 Coffeehouse

</h3><p>

In true Hillcrest tradition, it was only a matter of time before we had a coffeehouse.  Again I helped set it up, but this year I was given the chance to MC the whole thing.  So, armed with a whole cache of terrible jokes, I got up and started the thing.  It went fairly well.  Oh, and thanks to Elaine for the pictures since I couldn't take pictures whilst organizing the whole thing.

The crowd assembles in anticipation of the first coffeehouse of the year.  If you look closely, you can even spot some Main Campbellonians in the audience.

I got the program going with a monologue of bear jokes.  For instance: what kind of bear dissolves in water?  A polar bear!  But look, two wireless microphones!  Horrah!  One of them is mine, even.

Meanwhile, this sort of thing is happening in the audience.  Oh Will, my Freshman Honors Seminar mentee, and Juila, that person who lives down the hall.  Both really weird people.  And I honestly don't hold it against them.

Jeremy says "Applause," darn it!  And in the background, I run the game board.  It's really a powerpoint presentation with clickable objects that I run on a borrowed tablet computer.  Once I hook it up to the projector and the speakers, we're off.  I think it went over fairly well.

Picture courtesy of Erin (one of the four of them in the building... it's all very confusing) of me doing a little interview of David to pass the time while he tunes up.  I mean, you've got to get everybody to know each other, right?  Isn't that the general idea of a community.

A stringed duet with David and Pete to end the coffeehouse.  Horrah, horrah.  See you in early November for the next one, right after the Kent State football game.  Maybe they're somebody our team can actually beat.
