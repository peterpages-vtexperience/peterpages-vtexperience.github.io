What is a tow party, you may ask?  Allow me to explain: Alumni desparately want to relive their college days.  One way that the university lets them do this is by selling season tickets to football games.  The Alumni are willing to pay outrageous sums for this privilege.  Therefore, Tech tries to cater to their wishes.

But one of the other perks of paying them insane amounts of money is a close parking space.  And so on the evening before each home football game, Parking Services comes out to take care of the cars that students carelessly left in the various restricted lots.<br> <br>At 10:00, you are supposed to have your car out.  Parking services gives you a ticket and calls your contact number to give you one last chance to move your car.  At 11:00pm sharp, the tow trucks arrive.

What we do as a group is go down and watch the towing occur.  It is a spectacle that has become known as the Tow Party.  Man, we are such terrible people.<br> <br>We did get there a bit too early, so fortunately we had a gigantic frisbee to keep us busy.

I had a projector, too.  But it won't really turn on for some reason.  So I got a bunch of electrical/computer engineers to look at it.  Their verdict: "Don't mess around with it too much, because some of those things in there could kill you."

So I proceeded to close it up very carefully.  Too bad.  There's another auction in late October, and I might try to get another one then.
