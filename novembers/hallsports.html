    <h3>Section 1:<br>Hall Sports</h3>
    <p>During football season, a number of people carried around footballs.  Seemingly every time someone would throw one of these footballs, an RA would appear and say something to the effect of "no hall sports, guys."  From then on, the concept of "Hall Sports" has become sort of a joke around the building.  There has been lots of joking around, with people chiding each other for alleged hall sports.  So here's a compilation of some of the more bizzarre hall sports we've seen around the building.</p>

    <td colspan="2">Oh, and then on the eve of rearranging their room, Kevin and Jeremy down the hall vacummed out their carpet... on some carpet...in the hall...around 1:30 in the morning.  Kevin's working, and Jeremy's kind of just messing around.

    <td colspan="2">One night after everybody went to a community dinner (and all of the freshman engineers and I went to take Test #2), we had the innagural occurance of Late Night In-Hall Talking While Well Dressed.  Afterwards, somebody even brought out a guitar, making the event LNINTWWDWG (with Guitars).</td>

We didn't play particularly well, so around about halftime, a nice card game was going on (Hearts to be precise) on the floor in front of the TV.  Oh, and these people sitting around on the couches are still watching the game... just the one on the floor, not the one on TV.</td>

Then, one day, I finally found out.  The goal in this move is (apparently) to get your feet up as high above your head as possible while keeping your body straight, using only your momentum, and staying in that position for as long as possible.</td>

I know the first time I saw it I thought it looked kind of lame, but after trying it once one night, I learned that it is acctually fairly good exercise.  Stay tuned for some pictures of the Unofficial DDR Exam Break in the December issue.</td>
