<table width="90%" class="intro"><tr><td><br>Closing out the year by continuing in the vein of vaguely literary webisode titles, we come to the bleak December.  In Blacksburg, the weather does get mildly depressing in the winter.  However, all that means is that the action moves indoors.  See what kinds of crazy stuff Hillcrest residents were up to in this year's action packed, special effects bonanza finale!</td></tr>

    <h3>Section 1:<br>Snow Daze</h3>
    <p>The snow tends to stick around (get it?) here in Blacksburg for weeks at a time.  It snows, and as long as temperatures stay where they should, we'll be left with two and three inches of snow on the grass for days on end.  Fortunately, there is a plethora of things for people to do indoors for the snowbound (and outdoors for the hearty types/those without nerve endings).  And as an added bonus, the snow makes the scenery ridiculously picturesque.</p>
