What is is about the winter that creates a shortage of pictures?  Is it that awkward period between the high points of the semester?  Probably.  In that case, we respectfully submit these pictures as an indication and a reminder of the (sometimes) calming and relaxing actives undertaken as the fall semester winds down and the spring semester begins to heat up.

After what had been an extremely mild fall, winter came down with a vengance.  So we all tried to stay inside and keep a low profile.  Unfortunately, it also happened to be the end of the semester, so with all fo the exams and the exciting, action packed conclusion of NerdFest we found this rather difficult.

Originally, the plan was to get a member of the Honors staff to host the event, in the interests of impartiality and all.  However, after a test run at the first fall coffeehouse (about halfway down <a href="../fall06/coffeehouse.html" target="_blank">this page</a>), we found out that Second Floor Greg was the perfect match for the job.

After the Hillcrest team realized that these answers (graciously provided by Summit Community and Theme Housing RAs) were quite obscure, they came up with a strategy of Playing versus passing, thus leaving the Main Campbell team to guess the nigh-impossible final answer to steal the points.

<br><small><b><u>A NOTE ABOUT THE FAMILY FEUD SYSTEM:</b></u><br><br>I'm actually fairly proud of how it turned out.  For about a week before the first coffeehouse and a week and a half before the actual event, my only hobby was working on the game system.  Four computers were needed for sheer awesomeness contained within the programs.<br><br>The game itself was a very complicated powerpoint program utilizing trigger rectangles.  When the presentation was run on a tablet computer, the operator (in this case, Jeremy and Dr. Papillon) could simply tap the screen in a designated location to either reveal a correct answer or display X's to signify an incorrect answer.  Oh, and I found WAV files of the actual game sounds to play in association with the various slide actions.<br><br>All of the other displays were simply websites.  I made HTML files for what I wanted to show on the screen and used a computer running in extended desktop mode for the display.  That way, I could have the raw HTML file showing on the laptop screen while showing the associated website in Fullscreen mode on the attached TV (try it, just hit the F11 key to toggle it on or off).  For the scoreboards, it was a simple matter of changing a number in the HTML and setting the webpage up to refresh automatically every second so by saving the HTML the page would automatically update.  Finding an LCD-esque monospaced font also helped.  For the other displays, I just used the same kind of page to automatically display whatever was typed into a text file or made some sort of dynamic image swap using javascript.<br><br>All of these laptops were connected through combinations of s-video and composite video cables and appropriate adapters.  Do you need to hook your computer up to a TV?  Ask me, I've got plenty of spare cables to lend out.<br><br>Sorry for the interlude, but I just wanted to get that out there.  I spent a fair amount of time on this.<br><br></small>

I actually bought 3 of them in a lot.  I sold one off, so now I wound up paying about $10 each.  The unit is the black plastic thing with the orange "ET" painted on it twice.  It has a transparent window containing a liquid crystal display, and when it is placed on a really bright light (like this overhead projector), the image is illuminated and in this case projected onto a wall.  Assuming the room is dark enough, that is.
